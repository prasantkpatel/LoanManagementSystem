# LoanManagementSystem
A Java desktop application built using JavaSE(business logic), JavaFx(GUI), MySQL(backend database). The design pattern used is the infamous MVC(Model View Controller). This is, by no means, a serious attempt in building an actual loan management system. But it can serve as a nice starting point for understanding software development. It also makes one appreciate how big of a difference a good design pattern can make in the ease of developing an application. This  project was given to me by the course instructor as a part of the OOP course during my 4th semester of college

Dependency information is included in the file moduleinfo.java\	                                                                                                   
EclipseIDE is used for building the project. Using the same to run the project could turn out to be of great help!
